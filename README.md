# Space Invaders Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Space Invaders** game built using the Raylib library in C++. It was developed as a learning project to explore game development and the fundamentals of 2D graphics.

## Features
- **Classic Arcade Gameplay**: Control a spaceship to shoot down waves of invaders.
- **High Scores**: Keep track of your best scores across sessions.
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive movement and shooting mechanics.
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Simple graphics reminiscent of the original arcade game.

## How to Play
- **Movement**: Use the **LEFT** and **RIGHT** arrow keys to move your spaceship.
- **Shooting**: Press the **SPACE** bar to shoot lasers at the invading enemies.
- **Objective**: Destroy all invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen.

## Installation
This project is provided as a standalone executable and does not require an installer.

### Steps:
1. Download the `.exe` file from the [releases](#) section.
2. Run the `.exe` on your Windows machine.

**Note**: No additional dependencies are required. The game is designed to run on any standard Windows system.

## Compiling from Source
If you'd like to compile the game from source, you'll need:
- Raylib library installed
- A C++ compiler (such as MinGW or MSVC)

To compile the game yourself, follow these steps:

1. Install the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library.
2. Use your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
3. Compile the source code along with Raylib dependencies.
